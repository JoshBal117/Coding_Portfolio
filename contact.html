								<h2>Who I am, and what I do.</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My name is Joshua Balao; I am a Full Stack Website developer. I am also a dedicated husband and a father of three and they are the reason that I seek excellence in every project that I do. My wife and I have been married for almost 6 years. And I we enjoy taking our family on vacations. </p>

							<p>If you are unfamiliar with a Full Stack Web Developer, this means that I am able to build you a website and/or similar application; from the functionality of the application or app, to the atheistic and feel of the site.  I am able to design for you the perfect website that will best represent of you and your business. My full dedication to ensuring that you are getting the best product available is my number one desire. </p>

							<p>I have graduated from the UCF coding program, and every single project that I worked on provided me with actual experience. The numerous applications that I showcase on this Portfolio are full functioning applications, and they are the best representation of my work. A few of the projects here are group ones and we are still updating and adding to the projects to bring them to a full vision that we have, when we first sat down as a team to design them. </p>
